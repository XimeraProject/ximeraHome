Ximera provides the technology and community support for free and open mathematics education materials. Built with the support of instructors and faculty from multiple institutions, the project supports open educational resources (OER), curates existing resources, and builds the technology that enables instructors to take control of assessment.


All content is created in \LaTeX\  and published as a traditional PDF and as an online interactive document. 

The \LaTeX-code of a Ximera course is stored in Git, and can be build and published from github.
